# The Outpost

* **Web-native in its purest form:** Themes run on the [evergreen web](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/evergreen-web/). We leverage the latest web browsers to their fullest, while maintaining support for the older ones through progressive enhancement—not polyfills.
* **Lean, fast, and reliable:** Functionality and design defaults to “no” until it meets this requirement. Code ships on quality. Themes must be built with purpose. They shouldn’t support each and every feature in Shopify.
* **Server-rendered:** HTML must be rendered by Shopify servers using Liquid. Business logic and platform primitives such as translations and money formatting don’t belong on the client. Async and on-demand rendering of parts of the page is OK, but we do it sparingly as a progressive enhancement.
* **Functional, not pixel-perfect:** The Web doesn’t require each page to be rendered pixel-perfect by each browser engine. Using semantic markup, progressive enhancement, and clever design, we ensure that themes remain functional regardless of the browser.

## Getting started
We recommend using Dawn as a starting point for theme development. [Learn more on Shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/themes/getting-started/create).

> If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then you can use Dawn as a starting point. However, the theme that you submit needs to be [substantively different from Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/store/requirements#uniqueness) so that it provides added value for merchants. Learn about the [ways that you can use Dawn](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/dawn#ways-to-use-dawn).

Please note that the main branch may include code for features not yet released. The "stable" version of Dawn is available in the theme store.
